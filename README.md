# CellSim
Side project for fun that crudely simulates cell and cell colony lifecycles.  Hack on it in my free time when I'm bored.  Started as an HTML5 project but was hitting bottlenecks with how complex it was getting.  Decided to reproduce in C++ for fun.

Not using Visual Studio to become more familiar with command line arguments and how they work.  Will probably use it in the future.

## Requirements:
* SDL2-2.28.1
* SDL2_image-2.6.3
* SDL2_ttf-2.20.2

## Todo:
* UI and controls
* Clean up cell tracking, group into colonies to more easily keep track of texture and total count for cleanup purposes
